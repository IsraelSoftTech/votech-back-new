# Votech Backend - Refactored Structure

This document describes the refactored backend structure that breaks down the heavy `server.js` file into organized, modular route files.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The backend has been refactored from a monolithic `server.js` file into a modular structure with separate route files for different functionalities.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Middleware
All protected routes use the `authenticateToken` middleware from `utils.js`:
```javascript
const { authenticateToken } = require('./routes/utils');
router.get('/protected-route', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  // Route logic here
});
```

### Admin Authorization
Admin-only routes use the `requireAdmin` middleware:
```javascript
const { requireAdmin } = require('./routes/utils');
router.post('/admin-only', authenticateToken, requireAdmin, (req, res) => {
  // Admin route logic here
});
```

## 📊 Activity Logging

All routes automatically log user activities using the `logUserActivity` function:
```javascript
const { logUserActivity, getIpAddress, getUserAgent } = require('./routes/utils');

// Log activity
const ipAddress = getIpAddress(req);
const userAgent = getUserAgent(req);
await logUserActivity(
  req.user.id,
  'create',
  'Created new item',
  'item_type',
  itemId,
  itemName,
  ipAddress,
  userAgent
);
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with:
```
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER_NAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### 3. Run the Refactored Server
```bash
node server-refactored.js
```

### 4. Test the API
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/test
```

## 🔄 Migration from Original Server

To migrate from the original `server.js` to the refactored version:

1. **Backup the original server**:
   ```bash
   cp server.js server.js.backup
   ```

2. **Replace with refactored version**:
   ```bash
   cp server-refactored.js server.js
   ```

3. **Test all endpoints** to ensure functionality is preserved

## 📈 Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Modularity**: Each functionality is in its own file
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific features
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new route modules
4. **Code Reuse**: Shared utilities reduce duplication
5. **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested separately
6. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
7. **Performance**: Better code organization leads to faster development

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not found**: Ensure all route files exist in the `routes/` directory
2. **Database connection**: Check environment variables and database credentials
3. **Authentication errors**: Verify JWT_SECRET is set correctly
4. **CORS issues**: Ensure frontend URL is allowed in CORS configuration

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
process.env.DEBUG = 'true';
```

## 📝 Contributing

When adding new features:

1. Create a new route file in `routes/` directory
2. Follow the existing naming conventions
3. Use shared utilities from `utils.js`
4. Add proper error handling and logging
5. Update this documentation

## 🔗 API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, refer to the individual route files or use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to generate documentation from the route definitions.
